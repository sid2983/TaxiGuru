#### Dataset Overview
This dataset presents an opportunity to construct predictive models aimed at estimating the total amount paid by travelers for taxi journeys. With access to a training set containing the target variable 'total_amount' along with various informative features, participants are challenged to create accurate predictive models.

#### Data Files
The dataset is composed of the following files:

<b>train.csv:</b> The training set, which includes the target variable 'total_amount' and accompanying feature attributes.

<b>test.csv:</b> The test set, containing similar feature attributes but without the target variable 'total_amount,' as it is the variable to be predicted.

<b>sample_submission.csv:</b> A sample submission file provided in the correct format for competition submissions.

#### Columns Description

The dataset comprises various columns, each offering valuable insights into taxi rides. Notably:

<b>total_amount:</b> The total amount paid by the traveler for the taxi ride.

<b>VendorID:</b> An identifier for taxi vendors.

<b>tpep_pickup_datetime and tpep_dropoff_datetime:</b> Timestamps indicating pickup and dropoff times.

<b>passenger_count:</b> The number of passengers during the ride.

<b>trip_distance:</b> The distance traveled during the trip.

<b>RatecodeID:</b> Rate code for the ride.

<b>store_and_fwd_flag:</b> A flag indicating whether the trip data was stored and forwarded.

<b>PULocationID and DOLocationID:</b> Pickup and dropoff location identifiers.

<b>payment_type:</b> Payment type used for the ride.

Other columns are self-explanatory and contribute to the modeling process.
