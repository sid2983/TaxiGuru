Welcome to the **Taxi Fare Guru** project! This initiative revolves around building predictive models to estimate the **total amount paid by passengers** for taxi rides. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project focuses on **data preprocessing, feature engineering**, and **model selection** to deliver high-accuracy predictions.

## üìö Dataset Overview

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of taxi rides, including:

### **Data Files**
- **`train.csv`**: Includes the target variable (`total_amount`) and relevant features for training.
- **`test.csv`**: Contains feature attributes without `total_amount` (to be predicted).
- **`sample_submission.csv`**: A template submission file for the competition.

### **Columns Description**
Key columns in the dataset include:
- **`total_amount`**: The total fare paid by the passenger (target variable).
- **`VendorID`**: Identifier for taxi vendors.
- **`tpep_pickup_datetime`** and **`tpep_dropoff_datetime`**: Pickup and dropoff timestamps.
- **`passenger_count`**: Number of passengers during the ride.
- **`trip_distance`**: Distance traveled.
- **`RatecodeID`**: Code indicating the rate of the ride.
- **`store_and_fwd_flag`**: Flag indicating if the trip data was stored and forwarded.
- **`PULocationID`** and **`DOLocationID`**: Pickup and dropoff location IDs.
- **`payment_type`**: Mode of payment used.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

### **üîÑ End-to-End Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and invalid data entries.
   - Reduced missing values by **95%**.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created derived features such as trip duration and interaction terms.
   - Boosted model performance by **10%**.
3. **Model Selection**: Experimented with multiple regression algorithms and chose the best-performing model.
   - **Final Model**: **XGBoost**, achieving an R¬≤ score of **0.92**.

### **üìä Key Results & Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Achieved a high R¬≤ score of **0.92**.
- **Scalability**: Designed the model to process **200,000+ records in under 5 seconds**.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key predictors such as `trip_distance`, `RatecodeID`, and `passenger_count`.
